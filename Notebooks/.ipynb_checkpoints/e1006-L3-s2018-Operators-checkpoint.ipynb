However, on September 23, 1999, communication with the spacecraft was lost as the spacecraft went into orbital insertion, due to ground-based computer software which produced output in non-SI units of pound (force)-seconds (lbf·s) instead of the SI units of newton-seconds (N·s) specified in the contract between NASA and Lockheed.

    "But the highest value the counter could register was 255. If the program reached 256 checks, the counter automatically clicked back to zero, the same way that a car odometer turns over to zero after you've driven more than 99,999.99 kilometres. For that split second, the Therac-25 believed it was safe to proceed when, in fact, it wasn't. If the technician hit the \"set\" button to begin treatment at that precise moment, the turntable would be in the wrong position and the patient would be struck by a raw beam.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "\"Software quality assurance (SQA) consists of a means of monitoring the software engineering processes and methods used to ensure quality. The methods by which this is accomplished are many and varied, and may include ensuring conformance to one or more standards, such as ISO 9000 or a model such as CMMI.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQA encompasses the entire software development process, which includes processes such as requirements definition, software design, coding, source code control, code reviews, software configuration management, testing, release management, and product integration. SQA is organized into goals, commitments, abilities, activities, measurements, and verifications.\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_quality_assurance)\n",
