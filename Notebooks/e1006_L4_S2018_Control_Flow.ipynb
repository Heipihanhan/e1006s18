    "- From mathematics, \"a function from $\\textbf{A}$ to $\\textbf{B}$ is an object $f$ such that every $\\textbf{a} \\in \\textbf{A}$ is uniquely associated with an object $f( \\textbf{a} ) \\in \\textbf{B}$. A function is therefore a many-to-one (or sometimes one-to-one) relation. The set $\\textbf{A}$ of values at which a function is defined is called its domain, while the set $\\textbf{f(A)} \\subset \\textbf{B}$ of values that the function can produce is called its range.\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note:__ $\\textbf{a} \\in \\textbf{A}$ and $\\textbf{f{a}} \\in \\textbf{B}$ can be compound, i.e. a vector of more basic elements drawn from sets.\n",
