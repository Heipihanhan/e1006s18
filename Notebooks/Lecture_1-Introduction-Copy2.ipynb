    "\n",
    "- Both programs solve the problem (I think).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two different programs come up with two different, but similar answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both programs are pretty unintelligible, even to someone who understands the programming language and the [algorithm](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/question717.htm). The concept of and study of __algorithms__ is central to this course.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### The O-1 Knapsack Problem and the two different solutions highlight core concepts in _Computing_\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax and Semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Syntax is the grammar and rules of a language.\n",
    "    - Computer programming languages have very precise and strict rules about syntax.\n",
    "    - A missing colon, the wrong placement of an '=', etc. mean the computer will not execute your programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Semantics is the _meaning_ of the program. \n",
    "    - \"Butterflies ski sadly on unicorns\" is syntactically correct but has semantically meaningless.\n",
    "    - \"Today is Tuesday\" is syntactically correct but not a semantically meaningul answer to the question, \"Is it snowing?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The computer executed both programs, but ...\n",
    "    - Without my explanation, even after this course, figuring out the semantic intent would be hard.\n",
    "    - And, without extensive testing and verification, we cannot be sure that the answer is correct (meaningful semantically).\n",
    "        \n",
    "#### Theory of Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is an simple but profound mathematical model that defines _computation._\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are some problems that we can imagine, seem reasonable but for which we cannot compute a solution.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Computational Efficiency/Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computer Science provably classifies problems based on\n",
    "    - The amount of memory/computing time needed to solve a problem of size N.\n",
    "    - The underlying realization that two seemly different problems are actually the same problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can trade-off\n",
    "    - Using more memory to achieve a less CPU intensive solution, and vice-versa.\n",
    "    - Approximate, and often very good solutions, achieved quickly versus the absolutely correct solution in an absurdly long amount of time.\n",
    "    - Solution 1 above will always produce the correct answer.\n",
    "    - Solution 2 produces an approximate answer.\n",
    "    - But for more than 50 or 100 items, solving the problem takes longer than a lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "#### Algorithms and Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "- An _algorithm_ \"is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. Algorithms can perform calculation, data processing and automated reasoning tasks. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm)\n",

The free, open Anaconda distribution contains Jupyter Notebooks and [Spyder](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder), which is a popular [integrated development environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) (IDE) for Python. You can set up the Anaconda environment and begin playing with Jupyter and Spyder.\n",
